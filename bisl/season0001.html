  The Bristol Indoor Softball League 2000 - 01 </font> </b> <br> <br>

<p> All statistics have been lost to the mists of time....I would love to get a copy back. I can remember that Orange-1 won the league undefeated, but were beaten in the playoffs by Imperial, who went on to win overall. Was there a tournament?, I don't think that there was. In the home run race I remember that Adam beat out Pete to win the men's title - not that I am bitter! I'm afraid that I cannot remember who won the ladies' title.

<p> There were 8 teams: OR1, OR2, DES, IMP, RAC have appeared in all seasons. Chipmonks also played (those were the days: Al and I turned up with 6 ringers and the game still counted!) Did Guppies have a team?, Prairie Dogs?, Raiders?.....
